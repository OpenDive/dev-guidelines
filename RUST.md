# Rust Notes

```
The relationships between various data types in Rust are established using traits. 
```

```
A large part of learning Rust is understanding how the standard library traits operate, 
because that's the web of meaning that glues all the data types together.
```

```
Traits are interesting because there's no one-to-one correspondence between them and concepts from mainstream languages. 
It depends if you're thinking dynamically or statically. 
In the dynamic case, they're rather like Java or Go interfaces.
```

```
Composition is more important in Rust for the obvious reason that you can't inherit functionality in a lazy way from a base class.
